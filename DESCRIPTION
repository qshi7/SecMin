Description: Functions to fit data to van de Linden's (2006) https://doi.org/10.3102%2F10769986031002181 log-normal RT model as well as apply selected unsupervised (Kmeans & finite mixture modeling) and supervised (K-nearest neighbor & random forest) machine learning algorithms. Various IRT-, response-, and RT-based person fit estimates from the log-normal RT model are served as criteria to detect test frauds. Confusion matrices and serveral classification performance metrics of the machine learning algorithms are also provided.
